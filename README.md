I coded this game in a Java platform called Greenfoot and used some GitHub code to initiate the world and counter. 
I wrote the rest of the code myself in the Snake method, which defined its movement characteristics. 
Code:
#The snake moves around and turns after implementing the checkKeyPress() method.

#The game ends if Snake is crashing into a wall after implementing the atWorldEdge() method.

#Snake should eat food when it reaches the food after implementing the eat() method.

#A new food object is created when the current is eaten after implementing the newFood() method.

#Tail objects should be created behind the Snake head after implementing the addTailBehindHead() method.

#The oldest tail objects should be removed after implementing the eraseEndOfTail() method.

#The game should end if Snake is crashing into its tail after implementing the tailAhead() method.
